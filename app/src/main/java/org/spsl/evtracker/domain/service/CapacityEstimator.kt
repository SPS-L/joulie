/**
 * TASK-14 — battery-capacity degradation estimator.
 *
 * Two estimation paths per event, in priority order:
 *
 * 1. **Exact** — when both `socBefore` and `socAfter` are present and
 *    `socAfter > socBefore`, the effective capacity is
 *    `kwhAdded / (socAfter - socBefore)`. The SoC fields are stored as
 *    fractions in `0.0..1.0`.
 *
 * 2. **Heuristic** — when SoC fields are absent but `kwhAdded ≥
 *    HEURISTIC_FULL_CHARGE_FRACTION × batteryKwh`, use `kwhAdded` as a
 *    proxy. This catches near-full charges where the user didn't record
 *    SoC but probably charged from a low state.
 *
 * Events that satisfy neither rule are skipped. Events with `kwhAdded
 * ≤ 0` are always skipped. Events with `kwhSource = DERIVED_FROM_SOC`
 * (TASK-43) are also always skipped, on both paths — the derived
 * `kwhAdded` was itself computed from `Δsoc × nominalBatteryKwh`, so
 * any capacity calculation that round-trips through it is tautological
 * (exact path returns nominal verbatim; heuristic trivially qualifies).
